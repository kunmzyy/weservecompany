Data cleaning and transformation on weserve call center
This project concerns a company called weserve that outsources customer service personnel to different companies. These personnel agents are located in one call center receiving complaints from customers on calls and making calls out to customers to listen to their feedback and complaints regarding the products and services purchased from the varying companies.
The different calls made are recorded in a call log sheet and the extra details are saved in the call details sheet. 
As a data Engineer, I would understand the dataset and use the tools below to clean and transform the dataset into a suitable warehouse to make it easy for the customer service manager to be able to measure the KPI performance of the agents in order to drive the business forward.
